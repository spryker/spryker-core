Generic authorization module that can be used across different layers.

It provides the possibility to implement different authorization strategies using the `Spryker\Shared\AuthorizationExtension\Dependency\Plugin\AuthorizationStrategyPluginInterface`.

The general idea is that strategies have a name and when an authorization check is requested a strategy can be requested by name. This allows it to share a single strategy coming from one module between different modules and also makes it easy to change strategies.

An authorization request is composed in this way:

 * `AuthorizationRequestTransfer`
   * has one `AuthorizationIdentityTransfer`
   * has one `AuthorizationEntityTransfer`

The identity describes accessor and the entity the object the authoriziation is checked against.

An authorization check will return an `AuthorizationResponseTransfer`.
