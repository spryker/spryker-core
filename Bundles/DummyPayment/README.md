DummyPayment is a sample payment method that demonstrates a simple state machine which has a couple of states, commands and conditions. With that state machine it’s possible to trigger events for order items from Zed’s order detail page. It can be used as a starting point for new payment integrations. DummyPayment can also be used for testing checkout and order placement without actually performing transactions.
