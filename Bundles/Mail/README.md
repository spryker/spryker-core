Mail module helps to create emails to be sent. To send mails, Mail uses the email provider defined for the project and each provider behaves differently. One takes a fully rendered template and sends it, one just receives a request with query params and another one only works with a well formatted JSON. There are many ways Mail providers do their job. Therefore Mail module is suited to work easily with a wide range of providers. To get started a simple provider has been included. The default provider uses SwiftMailer.
