This module provides an example of a picking list generation strategy. Picking list strategies are used to define where and how order items are being picked.

A custom picklist generation strategy can be implemented on a project level per warehouse. The default picklist generation strategy includes the ability to generate picklists by order shipments, where each order line is assigned to a unique picklist that contains all the items needed to fulfill that order. This also includes splitting orders into multiple picklists depending on the warehouse assigned to each order line.

Keep in mind that this is just an example, you are free to implement any business logic using a strategy that will reflect your actual business processes.
