Shipment enables shipment features with shipment carriers and shipment methods. The shipment method is linked to the sales order which for example can be selected during checkout in Yves. Each shipment method is linked to a shipment carrier and a shipment carrier can have zero to many shipment methods. Shipping carriers and methods can be configured from Zed Administrative Interface.
