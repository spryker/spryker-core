Stock manages products stocks. It is possible to define several storage locations in which the products are stored. A product can have multiple stock entries associated with it, and each of these is associated to a storage location. Stocks can be attached only to concrete products. It is also possible to define a product as never out of stock by using a corresponding flag.
