Wishlist provides infrastructure and functionality to handle multiple wishlists for a customer account as well as manage wishlist items. A customer has a default wishlist, which will be created first time when there is a request made to manage its items. There is only one wishlist per customer by default, however one customer can have multiple named wishlists, if required. The wishlist is permanent and persists between sessions.
